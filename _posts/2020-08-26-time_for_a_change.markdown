I graduated college in 2017 with a bachelors degree in criminal justice, and I had absolutely no idea what I was going to do with it. I discovered probation and parole, and thought that the mix of social work, court, and law enforcement seemed like a good fit for me. Fast forward two and a half years later, and I have found myself burned out with my field. I very much enjoyed the court room side of my job, and thought that law school was my next move. After researching the law profession and started the proccess of studying for the LSAT, I quickly became disinterested.

I somehow stumbled upon some Youtube videos of a software engineer and became fascinated with the field. I loved how you could sit down at your computer, write some code, and create things. I always thought that I did not have the mind for computers as I compared it to math, which I struggled with growing up. But as I started on some basic HTML projects, I found myself really enjoying it! I researched a lot of different bootcamps and computer science programs. I teetered between Flatiron and another bootcamp, but decided that the more I thought about it, the more uncertain about the whole thing I would become. I decided to pull the trigger and sign up for Flatiron Part Time Software Engineering cohort. While it is difficult, as I am learning a whole new language essentially, I have appreciated the challenge that it brings. I look forward to learning more, building projects, and hopefully changing careers soon!
